This is OT_PPP.pm 1.1, a Perl interface to Open Transport/PPP 1.0.

REQUIREMENTS:
*MacPerl 5.1.1+ (5.1.3 recommended) is REQUIRED for fixed
    AppleEvents library.
*Open Transport and OT/PPP 1.0.
*Mac::Apps::Launch is required.

To install it, just drop the file OT_PPP.pm in the directory
lib:Mac:Comm.  Carefully look over the pod documentation that is 
included in the OT_PPP.pm file.  You can view it with Shuck (which 
accompanies  MacPerl) or with the pod2x translators in the MacPerl 
pod directory.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Mac/

The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  Use Stuffit Expander or a
similar program to get at the archive.

I think that is about it.  Let me know how things work out, and any
bugs, typos, suggestions, or anything else.
